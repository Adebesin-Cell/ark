description: Update documentation and agent files based on learnings from recent component development work
---

Review the conversation history and identify patterns, best practices, and learnings from recent component development
work. Then update the following files as needed:

## Files to Update

1. **`@.claude/docs/component_patterns.md`**
   - Add new component patterns discovered
   - Document common pitfalls and solutions
   - Add best practices for component API usage
   - Include documentation writing guidelines

2. **`@.claude/agents/component-example-creator.md`**
   - Update code quality standards based on learnings
   - Add new documentation guidelines
   - Include patterns for better example creation

3. **`@CLAUDE.md`** (if needed)
   - Update project-level guidance
   - Add new principles or conventions

## What to Include

Focus on **generic, reusable patterns** that will help with future component development:

- Component API access patterns (Context vs hooks)
- Common styling requirements
- Documentation writing best practices
- State management patterns
- Accessibility considerations
- Cross-framework consistency guidelines

## What to Exclude

Skip component-specific implementations unless they represent a broader pattern that applies to multiple components.

## Process

1. Review recent work and identify patterns
2. Read current documentation files to avoid duplication
3. Add new sections or update existing ones with clear examples
4. Use ✅ CORRECT / ❌ WRONG patterns for clarity
5. Include rationale for why patterns are important
6. Keep updates concise and actionable

After updating, provide a summary of what was added and why it will help future development work.
