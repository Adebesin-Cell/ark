## Anatomy

To set up the checkbox correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="checkbox" />

### Design impact on the asChild property

The `Checkbox.Root` element of the checkbox is a `label` element. This is because the checkbox is a form control and
should be associated with a label to provide context and meaning to the user. Otherwise, the HTML and accessibility
structure will be invalid.

> If you need to use the `asChild` property, make sure that the `label` element is the direct child of the
> `Checkbox.Root` component.

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Checkbox` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Controlled

Use the `checked` and `onCheckedChange` props to programatically control the checkbox's state.

<Example id="controlled" />

### Indeterminate

Use the `indeterminate` prop to create a checkbox in an indeterminate state (partially checked).

<Example id="indeterminate" />

### Checkbox Group

Ark provides a `Checkbox.Group` component to manage a group of checkboxes. The `Checkbox.Group` component manages the
state of the checkboxes and provides a way to access the checked values:

<Example id="group" />

### Access Checkbox state

Use the `Checkbox.Context` and its render prop to access the checkbox's state and methods.

<Example id="render-prop" />

### Field

The checkbox integrates smoothly with the `Field` component to handle form state, helper text, and error text for proper
accessibility.

<Example id="with-field" />

### Root Provider

Use the `useCheckbox` hook to create the checkbox store and pass it to the `Checkbox.RootProvider` component. This
allows you to have maximum control over the checkbox programmatically.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `Checkbox.RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Checkbox.Root` component.
