## Anatomy

To use the dialog component correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="dialog" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Dialog` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example

<Example id="basic" />

### Controlled

To create a controlled Dialog component, manage the state of the dialog using the `open` and `onOpenChange` props:

<Example id="controlled" />

### Lazy Mount

Lazy mounting is a feature that allows the content of a dialog to be rendered only when the dialog is first opened. This
is useful for performance optimization, especially when dialog content is large or complex. To enable lazy mounting, use
the `lazyMount` prop on the `Dialog.Root` component.

In addition, the `unmountOnExit` prop can be used in conjunction with `lazyMount` to unmount the dialog content when the
Dialog is closed, freeing up resources. The next time the dialog is activated, its content will be re-rendered.

<Example id="lazy-mount" />

### Lazy Mount and Dynamic Imports

When using `lazyMount` and dynamically rendering components in the dialog (via `React.lazy`, Next.js `dynamic`), wrap
the imported component in a `Suspense` component to render a fallback.

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/react/dialog'
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('./HeavyComponent'))

export default function DialogExample() {
  return (
    <Dialog.Root lazyMount>
      <Dialog.Trigger>Open Dialog</Dialog.Trigger>
      <Dialog.Content>
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
          <HeavyComponent />
        </Suspense>
      </Dialog.Content>
    </Dialog.Root>
  )
}
```

### Render Function

Use the `Dialog.Context` component to access the dialog's state and methods.

<Example id="render-fn" />

### Root Provider

Use the `useDialog` hook to create the dialog store and pass it to the `Dialog.RootProvider` component. This allows you
to have maximum control over the dialog programmatically.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `Dialog.RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Dialog.Root` component.
