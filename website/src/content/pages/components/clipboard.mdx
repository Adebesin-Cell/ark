## Anatomy

To set up the Clipboard correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="clipboard" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Clipboard` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Using Context

Access the clipboard state and methods using `Clipboard.Context`. This provides access to properties like `copied`, `value`, `setValue`, and `copyCalled`.

<Example id="context" />

### Controlled

Control the clipboard value externally by managing the state yourself and using `onValueChange` to handle updates.

<Example id="controlled" />

### Root Provider

Use the `useClipboard` hook to create the clipboard store and pass it to the `Clipboard.RootProvider` component. This
allows you to have maximum control over the clipboard programmatically.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `Clipboard.RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Clipboard.Root` component.
