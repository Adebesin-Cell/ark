## Anatomy

To set up the file upload component correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="file-upload" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `FileUpload` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Initial Files

Use the `defaultAcceptedFiles` prop to set the initial files in the file upload component.

<Example id="initial-files" />

### Clear Trigger

Use the `ClearTrigger` component to provide users with a way to remove all uploaded files at once. This trigger will
clear both accepted and rejected files from the upload component.

<Example id="clear-trigger" />

### Drag & Drop

Use the `Dropzone` component to enable drag-and-drop functionality. The dropzone provides adds a `data-dragging`
attribute while dragging for styling purposes.

<Example id="drag-and-drop" />

**Disable dropzone**

To disable drag-and-drop functionality, set the `allowDrop` prop to `false`.

```tsx
<FileUpload.Root allowDrop={false}>{/* ... */}</FileUpload.Root>
```

**Prevent document drop**

By default, when the dropzone is active, we prevent accidental navigation when files are dropped outside the dropzone.
To prevent this behavior, set the `preventDocumentDrop` prop to `false`.

```tsx
<FileUpload.Root preventDocumentDrop={false}>{/* ... */}</FileUpload.Root>
```

### Accepted File Types

Use the `accept` prop to restrict the file types that can be uploaded. This prop accepts MIME types (e.g., `image/png`,
`image/jpeg`) or file extensions (e.g., `.pdf`, `.txt`).

When users attempt to upload files that don't match the accepted types, these files will be automatically rejected and
appear in the `rejectedFiles` array with a `FILE_INVALID_TYPE` error code.

<Example id="accepted-file-types" />

### Error Handling

The `FileUpload` component provides comprehensive validation and error handling capabilities. You can set various
constraints and handle different types of validation errors:

**Built-in Validation Props:**

- `maxFiles` - Maximum number of files allowed
- `maxFileSize` - Maximum file size in bytes
- `minFileSize` - Minimum file size in bytes
- `accept` - Allowed MIME types or file extensions

**Built-in Error Types:**

- `TOO_MANY_FILES` - Exceeds maxFiles limit
- `FILE_INVALID_TYPE` - File type not in accept list
- `FILE_TOO_LARGE` - File size exceeds maxFileSize
- `FILE_TOO_SMALL` - File size below minFileSize
- `FILE_INVALID` - Generic validation failure
- `FILE_EXISTS` - Duplicate file detected

<Example id="error-handling" />

### Custom Validation

Use the `validate` prop to implement custom validation logic beyond the built-in constraints.

<Example id="validation" />

### Field

Here's an example of how to use the `FileUpload` component with the `Field` component to provide a error and helper
text.

<Example id="with-field" />

### Root Provider

Use the `useFileUpload` hook to create the file upload store and pass it to the `RootProvider` component. This allows
you to have maximum control over the file upload programmatically.

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

<Example id="root-provider" />

### Pasting Files

Use the `setClipboardFiles` method to enable pasting images directly from the clipboard.

> You can access the `fileUpload` store from `FileUpload.Context` as well.

<Example id="with-paste" />
