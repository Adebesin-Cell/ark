## Anatomy

To set up the file upload component correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="file-upload" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `FileUpload` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Accepted File Types

Use the `accept` prop to restrict the file types that can be uploaded. This prop accepts MIME types (e.g., `image/png`,
`image/jpeg`) or file extensions (e.g., `.pdf`, `.txt`).

When users attempt to upload files that don't match the accepted types, these files will be automatically rejected and
appear in the `rejectedFiles` array with a `FILE_INVALID_TYPE` error code.

The example below demonstrates how to accept only PNG and JPEG images using `accept="image/png,image/jpeg"`.

<Example id="accepted-file-types" />

### Initial Files

Use the `defaultAcceptedFiles` prop to set the initial files in the file upload component.

<Example id="initial-files" />

### Validation

Use the `validate` prop to validate the files before they are uploaded. The return value of the function should map to:

- `TOO_MANY_FILES`: If the user tries to upload more files than the `maxFiles` prop allows.
- `FILE_INVALID_TYPE`: If the file is of an invalid type.
- `FILE_TOO_LARGE`: If the file is too large.
- `FILE_TOO_SMALL`: If the file is too small.
- `FILE_INVALID`: If the file is invalid (for any other reason).
- `FILE_EXISTS`: If the file already exists.

<Example id="validation" />

### Field

Here's an example of how to use the `FileUpload` component with the `Field` component to provide a error and helper
text.

<Example id="with-field" />

### Root Provider

Use the `useFileUpload` hook to create the file upload store and pass it to the `FileUpload.RootProvider` component.
This allows you to have maximum control over the file upload programmatically.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

### Pasting Files

Use the `setClipboardFiles` method to enable pasting images directly from the clipboard.

> You can access the `fileUpload` store from `FileUpload.Context` as well.

<Example id="with-paste" />
