## Anatomy

To set up the carousel correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="carousel" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Carousel` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Controlled

To create a controlled Carousel component, you can manage the state of the carousel using the `index` prop and update it
when the `onIndexChange` event handler is called:

<Example id="controlled" />

### Autoplay

The Carousel can play automatically. Just add the `autoplay` prop. You'll probably want to add `loop` too, so it keeps
going after the last slide.

<Example id="autoplay" />

### Root Provider

Use the `useCarousel` hook to create the carousel store and pass it to the `Carousel.RootProvider` component. This
allows you to have maximum control over the carousel programmatically.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `Carousel.RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Carousel.Root` component.
