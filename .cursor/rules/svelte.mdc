- Make sure to export the `*BaseProps`
- `children?: Snippet` already exists in `HTMLArkProps<X>` so no need to define it
- Every `use*` hook must return and `Accessor<T>`
- For `*-root.svelte` files where `value` or `open` is a valid prop, make sure you setup the `$bindable()` for it.
- For `*-context.svelte` files, prefer to use `render` not `children` prop
- Always export pattern is `export { default as Component}`
- All imports in examples must use `@ark-ui/svelte/<component>`
